## Purpose ##
Teaches often have to take 5-10 minutes at the begenning of each class to check if each student is actually present, and with distance learning it has only become harder to do so. Our website solves this issue by letting the teachers know who's not there, just by taking in a master list of all the students in the class and a screenshot of the participant's list.
